#   scripts/make_golden_runs.sh
#
# Each is written by its Rust test on the simulator, unpaced, with the
# simulator's fixed seed, and normalized (wall times, the run's unique identity
# and the build fields fixed). Without this script the same tests only compare
# today's code against the folders. Review the difference before committing it:
# a changed golden folder is a changed run record.

# Written for bash 3.2, the bash macOS ships.
