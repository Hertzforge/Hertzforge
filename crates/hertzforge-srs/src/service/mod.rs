//! `SrsShockService` - the SRS-shock run orchestration, mirroring
//! `hertzforge-random::service::RandomService` / the Explorer service's shape: an explicit
//! state machine, a timestamped event log, a serde [`report::ReportData`], and a live
//! [`report::Status`] snapshot.
//!
//! # The state machine
//!
//! ```text
//! Idle -> Feasibility -> SysId -> Armed -> Firing -> Stopped
//!            |  (hard block)       ^
//!            v                     | (delegated / sysid disabled skips SysId)
//!       FeasibilityBlocked --------+   (arm_with_override)
//! ```
//!
//! plus `Aborted` from any running state (envelope abort, kinematic ceiling,
//! drive breach, plant fault).
//!
//! # The per-pulse pipeline (Path B, [`SrsShockService::fire_pulse`])
//!
//! 1. **Synthesize** the drive from the CURRENT component table
//!    ([`crate::iterate::SynthesisEngine`]) and scale it by the ladder rung
//!    (the ladder owns the level; the law owns the shape).
//! 2. **Pre-fire drive check** (predictive side): predict the peak
//!    acceleration through the measured drive->control FRF and scale down (or
//!    abort at `drive_abort_factor x ceiling`) BEFORE firing.
//! 3. **Fire**: play the drive into the plant ([`plant::PulsePlant`]) and capture
//!    the control + monitor responses (with a ring-out window).
//! 4. **Ingest** into the [`hertzforge_shock_common::PulseStore`] (SRS +
//!    kinematics + optional PVSS computed on ingest) and stream to the capture
//!    sink when capturing.
//! 5. **Protect**: measured kinematic ceilings, then the
//!    log-octave tolerance envelope (level-normalized alarm/abort per band), then
//!    the between-pulse measured drive monitors (measured side; V/I
//!    inert on Path A via [`hertzforge_shock_common::PathCapabilities`]).
//! 6. **Iterate**: predict each limit channel's response SRS through its
//!    reduced-level FRF ([`crate::limit::predict_response_srs`]) and hand the
//!    measured control SRS + the predictions to [`crate::law::SrsSynthesisLaw`]
//!    ([`hertzforge_shock_common::ShockControlLaw::on_pulse`]); apply the returned
//!    per-component gains to the table (the next pulse re-synthesizes from them).
//!    Limit-down beats control-up (the Random arbitration rule).
//! 7. **Advance** the ladder (AUTO: N pulses per level; MANUAL: operator steps).
//!    A completed ladder stops the run cleanly.
//!
//! # The level/trim arbitration (documented precisely)
//!
//! Three scalars can shrink a fired pulse, and they are arbitrated differently:
//!
//! - **The ladder rung** is the commanded LEVEL. Both the envelope
//!   normalization and the law's target aim scale by it.
//! - **The between-pulse monitor trim** and the **pre-fire accel
//!   scale** are SAFETY scales. The LAW's target aim includes them (the law must
//!   not fight a limiter by pumping gains back up - the Random lesson), but the
//!   ENVELOPE normalization deliberately does NOT: a pulse held down by a drive
//!   limit reads LOW against the test's tolerance, which is exactly what the
//!   operator must see (alarm/abort-low is the surfacing mechanism for "this test
//!   cannot reach level under its drive limits").
//!
//! # Path honesty (cited per event in the log)
//!
//! Path B is the host loop above - on the Sim plant today. The DELEGATED path
//! (Path A) is reference-download + absolute-scalar fires: Hertzforge's control law
//! does NOT run on the device, the download is the UNCOMPENSATED
//! synthesis, there is no host system ID, and V/I
//! ceilings are inert. The capability truth is read from
//! [`hertzforge_shock_common::PathCapabilities`] - never re-derived here.
