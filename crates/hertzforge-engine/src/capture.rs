//! Capture seam: the boundary the engine hands each raw block through.
//!
//! The engine hands whole blocks of raw, interleaved f32 frames plus the timebase
//! metadata (epoch, starting frame index, and whether a gap precedes the block) to a
//! [`CaptureSink`]. The implementations in this workspace are the in-memory
//! [`VecCaptureSink`] and the test sinks; nothing behind this trait writes to disk.
//!
//! The recording a run keeps on disk is made elsewhere: a test service pushes samples
//! to `hertzforge_capture::CaptureSink`, which writes a raw interleaved f32 stream
//! (`telemetry.f32`) and a JSON sidecar (`capture.json`) on its own writer thread.
//! There is no HDF5 writer. A MIMO Random run folder can be converted to a `.hforge`
//! file afterwards, by the Python function `hertzforge.io.mimo_run_convert.convert`.
//!
//! A sink that cannot take a block returns [`CaptureError::WouldBlock`]; the scheduler
//! drops that block and goes on, never blocking the loop. The scheduler does not mark
//! the dropped frames: they are left out of the run report's `frames_captured`, and a
//! sink that needs to record the gap must do so itself. [`CaptureError::Fatal`] ends
//! the run.
