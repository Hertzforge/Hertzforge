"""What a selection in the project tree shows.

Visual Dynamics' window draws whatever is selected in its tree
(`gui.main_window.render_current`, `docs/guide/project-tree.md`): one
object by its kind, records picked inside one, or several together when
the combination means something. `project.show` answers the same from the
operations the service already has, so the shell draws a selection the
way a result is drawn.

One object: a geometry draws; a data object is its waterfall, or the
records picked as curves; a shape set is its modes on the geometry of its
group (or the active one) with its mode table, or the table and its MAC
against itself without one; a channel table and matched modes are their
tables. Two together: data on a geometry animates it (a shape set's modes;
a time history played back sample by sample; an FRF's or a spectrum's
operating deflection shape at its loudest line; a PSD's envelope); a
channel table on a geometry marks its channels; two shape sets give their
MAC; a measurement beside its requirement gives the comparison's spectra;
two PSDs overlay. Anything else shows each object on its own, and the note
says what was left out.
